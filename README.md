# One-and-Two-Aisles-Airplane-Boarding-Analysis-by-Agent-Based-Modeling
 we summarized  several previously proposed methods in one aisle airplane boarding process. We used  Agent-Based Modeling to reconstruct these models and analyzed the boarding  efficiency of these models. we also constructed the two axles  airplane and designed several original boarding methods.
