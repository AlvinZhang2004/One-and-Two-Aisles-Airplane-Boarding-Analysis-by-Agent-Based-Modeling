# One-and-Two-Aisles-Airplane-Boarding-Analysis-by-Agent-Based-Modeling
 we summarized  several previously proposed methods in one aisle airplane boarding process. We used  Agent-Based Modeling to reconstruct these models and analyzed the boarding  efficiency of these models. we also constructed the two axles  airplane and designed several original boarding methods.

Random Model
The random model assigns seats for passengers in complete randomness, without any prescribed methods.

By Section Model
The by-section model allows passengers to board in five groups, with seat column numbers 25-30 board first, then 19-24, 13-18, 7-12, and finally 1-6.
The by-section method does not control the passengersâ€™ row number (A to F), and passengers are randomly assigned with their exact column number within the range of the group.


Back to Front Model
The by-seat model allows passengers with seat row numbers A and F to board first, then B and E, and finally C and D.
